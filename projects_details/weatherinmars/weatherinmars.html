									<h4><i>...a simple yet complex project. Requires a quite diverse skillset</i></h4>
										<p>One of the most fun projects I have worked on. What I thought would be a simple 
											project involving only some API requests and data analysis became an extensive 
											idea that required me to get a RPi touchscreen, learn Flask app development, HTML/CSS, and using Google's 
											app engine. I even hired an artist friend to desing my website's background
										</p>
									<hr />

									
									<h2>Skillset</h2>
	
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>API requests</li>
												<li>Flask</li>
												<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
												<li>Python</li>
												<li>Data analysis</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<ul class="alt">
												<li>HTML5</li>
												<li>CSS</li>
												<li>Responsive website design</li>
												<li>Google App Engine</li>
												<li>Some artistic side :)</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									<hr />
									<h2>Process</h2>
										<p>The project is divided into three parts. Starting with the data gathering, I used different 
											data sources to collect information from Mars rovers. One of the main issues is that live 
											data is basically impossible due to the bandwidth of sending back the information. Therefore, 
											there will always be a delay in relay information - which can be from days to months. The second 
											and third parts of the projects are the display of the information. I originally thought of 
											only creating a Python-based GUI using an RPi's touchscreen display. However, the idea evolved 
											into also creating a website display the most up-to-date information.
										</p>
										<h3>Accessing the Data</h3>
										
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<ol class="alt">
													<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlabsmobile.altimeterfree&hl=en_US">
														Accurate Altimeter</a></li>
													<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitbit.FitbitMobile&hl=en_US">
														Fitbit App</a></li>
												</ol>
												
											</div>
											<p>I will be using the two apps above as my data sources. The altimeter app produces 
												a CSV file that can be parsed using Python's pandas package. For the 
												Fitbit app, I will be creating an account and accessing their API.
											</p>
											<h2>Accurate Altimeter</h2>
											<p>This is a pretty good app that allows to measure your current altitude at 
												any moment. It has the capability to record continuously and set them up 
												at different time steps. You can also set the triangulization method to 
												derive your altitude from the internet or use your phone's GPS instead. 
												This is really helpful for those remote hikes where internet is spotty.
												However, my favorite feature is the ability to export your history to a 
												CSV and its compatibilty with Google Drive. This is my main method to 
												download the data without requiring to access the app's API.</p>
											<h2>Fitbit</h2>
											<p>Obtaining data from Fitbit is trickier. There is an option to download a CSV file from Fitbit's
												online account, but the file contains only a mere summary. Instead, their
											<a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/activity/#activity-time-series"><em>intraday time series</em></a>
												boasts a lot more options, allowing to extract data at different time steps for a wider category
												of activities. To do so, we'll need to access Fitbit's API.</p>
											<p>I've split this walkthrough in 3 main steps:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Creating and registering an application</li>
											<p>First, Fitbit requires to create and register an application on their developer's site.
												This can be done by simply filling out the application on this <a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new"> link</a>.
												Make sure you select "Personal" under the "OAuth2.0 Application Type" field. This allows to request any
												intraday time series without any additional access approvals. However, by selecting this field, your
												application will be limited to pulling personal data only.
											</p>
												<li>Authentication and authorization token</li>
											<p>Fitbit has upgraded their authentication requirements to OAuth2.0 only. Their <a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/oauth2/">
												website</a> has amazing documentation explaining both types of authentication flows you can obtain.
												I decided to use the "Authorization Code Flow" and my initial code was based on this thorough
												<a href="http://pdwhomeautomation.blogspot.com/2016/01/fitbit-api-access-using-oauth20-and.html">post</a>
												by Paul's Geek Dad Blog.<br>
												However, I found his authorization code request a bit restrictive, thus I refactored using Python's
												<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"><em>Requests</em></a> package instead.
											</p>
												<li>Requesting data</li>
											<p>To call the intraday time series I downloaded this <a href="https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit">
												Fitbit API client implementation package</a> created by <em>orcasgit</em>. To install the package, clone
												the github repo:
												<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:orcasgit/python-fitbit.git</code></pre></p>
												</ol>

									<h2>Graphs</h2>
									<p>Check my graphs and data in my <a href="https://plot.ly/~lvlarco">Plotly dashboard</a>.<br />
										All my graphs are interactive! You can hide each hike by clicking on it or double-click 
										on one to select it.</p>
