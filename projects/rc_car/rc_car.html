		<h3><em>if no one will buy me one, I'll make it myself</em></h3>
		<p>I never got a remote control car. I always wanted it but my parents never bought me one. Don't get me wrong... 
		my childhood lacked very little, but I just never got that <em>Tycho Scorcher</em>. Since I got my 3D printer, 
		I have been creating projects that intertwined printing and coding, and I saw this as my opportunity!<br>
		The main purpose of this project is to dust off my CAD design, try new printing designs, improve my coding, and learn about 
		hardware and bus communications.</p>

		<p>I will develop this project in several MVPs, building off from the previous one, and improving my design. I'd like to design
		and print all car parts, and code all logics for the car. Although there are several plug-and-play circuit boards to control
		the car components, I will only use a Raspberry Pi.<br>
		You can access my STL files for the chassis in my <a href="https://github.com/lvlarco/rc_repo">Github repo</a>.</p>
		<p>Currently working on my 3rd MVP. Take a look at my previous two:</p>
