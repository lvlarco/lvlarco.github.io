		<h1>Remote Control Car</h1>
		<h2>If no one will buy me one, I'll make it myself</h2>
		I never owned a remote control car. Always wanted it but never got it. Don't get me wrong, my childhood did not lack much; 
		I just never got that <em>Tycho Scorcher</em>. Since I got my 3D printer, I have been trying to create projects that 
		intertwined printing and coding. This was my opportunity!<br>
		
		The main purpose of this project is to dust off my CAD design, try new printing designs, improve my coding, and learn about 
		hardware and bus communications.<br>
		
		I will develop this project in several MVPs, building off from the previous one, and improving my design. I'd like to design
		and print all car parts, and code all logics for the car. Although there are several plug-and-play circuit boards to control
		the car components, I will only use a Raspberry Pi.<br>
		
		You can access my STL files for the chassis in my <a href="https://github.com/lvlarco/rc_repo">Github repo</a>.

		I'm bulding a remote control car from scratch. I am setting three goals for this project:<br>
		<ol><li><strong>Programming:</strong> develop Python code to drive the back wheels and steering using Raspberry Pi - <em>done</em></li>
			<li><strong>Wiring:</strong> design circuit to connect Pi to hardware, and to solder stripboard</li>
			<li><strong>Design & Print:</strong> use CAD to design chassis and mounts. Print parts and assemble</li>	
		</ol>
			
		<strong>Parts</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Raspberry Pi 2</li>
			<li>2 x 3-6V DC motor</li>
			<li>Servo motor</li>
			<li>L293D H-bridge</li>
			<li>4-pack AA battery holder</li>
		</ul>
		Connections and code was based and modified from <a href="https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/controlling-dc-motors-using-python-with-a-raspberry-pi--cms-20051">
		envatotuts+</a> and <a href="http://roverpi.blogspot.com/2013/07/controlling-two-dc-motors-with.html">
		Rover Pi</a><br>
		Switch code was loosely based in <a href="http://razzpisampler.oreilly.com/ch07.html">O'Reilly's Raspberry Pi Cookbook</a>
